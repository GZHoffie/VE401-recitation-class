# VE401 Probabilistic Methods in Engineering - Recitation Classes

This repository contains recitation class materials for UM-SJTU Joint Institute course VE401, Probabilistic Methods in Engineering. It aims to visualize and emphasize some key concept in class and illustrate with simple examples using Wolfram Mathematica, a powerful tool.

Keywords are listed in order as follows for easy searching and revisiting. I only list the first appearance of each concept.
